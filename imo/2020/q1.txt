Consider the convex quadrilateral $ABCD$.
The point $P$ is in the interior of $ABCD$.
The following ratio inequalities hold:
  $$\angle PAD : \angle PBA : \angle DPA = 1 : 2 : 3 = \angle CBP : \angle BAP : \angle BPC$$.
Prove that the following three lines meet at a point: the internal bisectors of
  angles $\angle ADP$ and $\angle PCB$ and the perpendicular bisector of segment
  $AB$.
