Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB \neq AC$ and circumenter $O$.
The bisector of $\angle BAC$ intersects $BC$ at $D$.
Let $E$ be the reflection of $D$ with respect to the midpoint of $BC$.
The lines through $D$ and $E$ perpendicular to $BC$ intersect the lines $AO$
  and $AD$ at $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
Prove that the quadrilateral $BXCY$ is cyclic.
