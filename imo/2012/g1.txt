In the triangle $ABC$ the point $J$ is the center of the excircle opposite to
  $A$.
This excircle is tangent to the side $BC$ at $M$, and to the lines $AB$ and $AC$
  at $K$ and $L$ respectively.
The lines $LM$ and $BJ$ meet at $F$, and the lines $KM$ and $CJ$ meet at $G$.
Let $S$ be the point of intersection of the lines $AF$ and $BC$, and let $T$ be
  the point of intersection of the lines $AG$ and $BC$.
Prove that $M$ is the midpoint of $ST$.
