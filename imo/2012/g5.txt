Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BCA = 90^\circ$, and let $C_0$ be the
  foot of the altitude from $C$.
Choose a point $X$ in the interior of the segment $CC_0$, and let $K,L$ be the
  points on the segments $AX,BX$ for which $BK = BC$ and $AL = AC$ respectively.
Denote by $M$ the intersection of $AL$ and $BK$.
Show that $MK = ML$.
