Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle and let $D$, $E$, and $F$ be the feet of
  altitudes from $A$, $B$, and $C$ to sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively.
Denote by $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ the incircles of triangles $BDF$ and $CDE$,
  and let these circles be tangent to segments $DF$ and $DE$ at $M$ and $N$,
  respectively.
Let line $MN$ meet circles $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ again at $P \neq M$ and
  $Q \neq N$, respectively.
Prove that $MP = NQ$.
