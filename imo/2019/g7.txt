The incircle $\omega$ of acute-angled scalene triangle $ABC$ has centre $I$ and
  meets sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively.
The line through $D$ perpendicular to $EF$ meets $\omega$ again at $R$.
Line $AR$ meets $\omega$ again at $P$.
The circumcircles of triangles $PCE$ and $PBF$ meet again at $Q \neq P$.
Prove that lines $DI$ and $PQ$ meet on the external bisector of angle $BAC$.
