Let $ABCDE$ be a convex pentagon with $CD = DE$ and
  $\angle EDC \neq 2 \cdot \angle ADB$.
Suppose that a point $P$ is located in the interior of the pentagon such that
  $AP = AE$ and $BP = BC$.
Prove that $P$ lies on the diagonal $CE$ if and only if
  $\text{area}(BCD) + \text{area}(ADE) = \text{area}(ABD) + \text{area}(ABP)$.
