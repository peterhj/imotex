Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with orthocenter $H$, and let $W$ be
  a point on side $BC$.
Denote by $M$ and $N$ the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$ respectively.
Denote by $\omega_1$ the circumcircle of $BWN$, and let $X$ be the point on
  $\omega_1$ which is diametrically opposite to $W$.
Analogously, denote by $\omega_2$ the circumcircle of $CWM$, and let $Y$ be
  the point on $\omega_2$ which is diametrically opposite to $W$.
Prove that $X$, $Y$, and $H$ are collinear.
