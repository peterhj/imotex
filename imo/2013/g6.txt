Let the excircle of the triangle $ABC$ lying opposite to $A$ touch its side
  $BC$ at the point $A_1$.
Define the points $B_1$ and $C_1$ analogously.
Suppose that the circumcentre of the triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ lies on the
  circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$.
Prove that triangle $ABC$ is right-angled.
