Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral.
A circle passing through the points $A$ and $D$ and a circle passing through
  the points $B$ and $C$ are externally tangent at a point $P$ inside the
  quadrilateral.
Suppose that
  $$\angle PAB + \angle PDC \le 90^\circ$$
  and
  $$\angle PBA + \angle PCD \le 90^\circ$$.
Prove that $AB + CD \ge BC + AD$.
