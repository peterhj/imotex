Circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with centres $O_1$ and $O_2$ are externally
  tangent at point $D$ and internally tangent to a circle $\omega$ at points
  $E$ and $F$ respectively.
Line $t$ is the common tangent of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at $D$.
Let $AB$ be the diameter of $\omega$ perpendicular to $t$, so that $A$, $E$,
  and $O_1$ are on the same side of $t$.
Prove that lines $AO_1$, $BO_2$, $EF$, and $t$ are concurrent.
