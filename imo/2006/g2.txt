Let $ABCD$ be a trapezoid with parallel sides $AB > CD$.
Points $K$ and $L$ lie on the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ respectively, so that
  $AK / KB = KL / LC$.
Suppose that there are points $P$ and $Q$ on the line segment $KL$ satisfying
  $$\angle APB = \angle BCD$$
  and
  $$\angle CQD = \angle ABC$$.
Prove that the points $P$, $Q$, $B$, and $C$ are concyclic.
