In triangle $ABC$, let $J$ be the centre of the excircle tangent to side $BC$
  at $A_1$ and to the extensions of sides $AC$ and $AB$ at $B_1$ and $C_1$
  respectively.
Suppose that the lines $A_1B_1$ and $AB$ are perpendicular and intersect at $D$.
Let $E$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $C_1$ to line $DJ$.
Determine the angles $\angle BEA_1$ and $\angle AEB_1$.
