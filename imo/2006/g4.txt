A point $D$ is chosen on the side $AC$ of a triangle $ABC$ with
  $\angle C < \angle A < 90^\circ$ in such a way that $BD = BA$.
The incircle of $ABC$ is tangent to $AB$ and $AC$ at points $K$ and $L$
  respectively.
Let $J$ be the incentre of triangle $BCD$.
Prove that the line $KL$ intersects the line segment $AJ$ at its midpoint.
