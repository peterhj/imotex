A circle $\omega$ of radius $1$ is given.
A collection $T$ of triangles is called \emph{good}, if the following conditions
  hold:
(i) each triangle from $T$ is inscribed in $\omega$;
(ii) no two triangles from $T$ have a common interior point.
Determine all positive real numbers $t$ such that, for each positive integer
  $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter
  greater than $t$.
