Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$.
Let $D$ and $E$ be points on the segments $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, such that
  $AD = AE$.
The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $BD$ and $CE$ intersect the small
  arcs $AB$ and $AC$ at points $F$ and $G$ respectively.
Prove that $DE \| FG$.
