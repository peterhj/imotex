Given an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with $AB = AC$.
The midpoint of side $BC$ is denoted by $M$.
Let $X$ be a variable point on the shorter arc $MA$ of the circumcircle of
  triangle $ABM$.
Let $T$ be the point in the angle domain $BMA$, for which
  $\angle TMX = 90^\circ$ and $TX = BX$.
Prove that $\angle MTB - \angle CTM$ does not depend on $X$.
