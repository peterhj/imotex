In triangle $ABC$, the angle bisector at vertex $C$ intersects the circumcircle
  and the perpendicular bisectors of sides $BC$ and $CA$ at points $R$, $P$, and
  $Q$, respectively.
The midpoints of $BC$ and $CA$ are $S$ and $T$, respectively.
Prove that triangles $RQT$ and $RPS$ have the same area.
