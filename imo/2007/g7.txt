Given an acute triangle $ABC$ with angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ at
  vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, such that $\beta > \gamma$.
Point $I$ is the incenter, and $R$ is the circumradius.
Point $D$ is the foot of the altitude from vertex $A$.
Point $K$ lies on line $AD$ such that $AK = 2R$, and $D$ separates $A$ and $K$.
Finally, lines $DI$ and $KI$ meet sides $AC$ and $BC$ at $E$ and $F$,
  respectively.
Prove that if $IE = IF$ then $\beta \leq 3\gamma$.
