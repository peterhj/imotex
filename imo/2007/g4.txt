Consider five points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ such that $ABCD$ is a parallelogram
  and $BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
Let $\ell$ be a line passing through $A$, and let $\ell$ intersect segment $DC$
  and line $BC$ at points $F$ and $G$, respectively.
Suppose that $EF = EG = EC$.
Prove that $\ell$ is the bisector of angle $DAB$.
