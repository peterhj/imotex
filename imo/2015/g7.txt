Let $ABC$ be a convex quadrilateral, and let $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be points on
  the sides $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, and $DA$, respectively.
Let the line segments $PR$ and $QS$ meet at $O$.
Suppose that each of the quadrilaterals $APOS$, $BQOP$, $CROQ$, and $DSOR$ has
  an incircle.
Prove that the lines $AC$, $PQ$, and $RS$ are either concurrent or parallel to
  each other.
