Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle $AB > AC$, and let $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle.
Let $H$, $M$, and $F$ be the orthocenter of the triangle, the midpoint of $BC$,
  and the foot of the altitude from $A$, respectively.
Let $Q$ and $K$ be the two points on $\Gamma$ that satisfy
  $\angle AQH = 90^\circ$ and $\angle QKH = 90^\circ$.
Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $KQH$ and $KFM$ are tangent to
  each other.
