Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $AC$.
A circle $\omega$ passing through $B$ and $M$ meets the sides $AB$ and $BC$
  again at $P$ and $Q$, respectively.
Let $T$ be the point such that the quadrilateral $BPTQ$ is a parallelogram.
Suppose that $T$ lies on the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$.
Determine all the possible values of $BT / BM$.
