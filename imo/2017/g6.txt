Let $n \ge 3$ be an integer.
Two regular $n$-gons $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ are given in the plane.
Prove that the vertices of $\mathcal A$ that lie inside $\mathcal B$ or on its
  boundary are consecutive.
(That is, prove that there exists a line separating those vertices of
  $\mathcal A$ that lie inside $\mathcal B$ or on its boundary from the other
  vertices of $\mathcal A$.)
