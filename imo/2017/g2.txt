Let $R$ and $S$ be distinct points on circle $\Omega$, and let $t$ denote the
  tangent line to $\Omega$ at $R$.
Point $R'$ is the reflection of $R$ with respect to $S$.
A point $I$ is chosen on the smaller arc $RS$ of $\Omega$ so that the
  circumcircle $\Gamma$ of triangle $ISR'$ intersects $t$ at two different
  points.
Denote by $A$ the common point of $\Gamma$ and $t$ that is closest to $R$.
Line $AI$ meets $\Omega$ again at $J$.
Show that $JR'$ is tangent to $\Gamma$.
