In triangle $ABC$, let $\omega$ be the excircle opposite $A$.
Let $D$, $E$, and $F$ be the points where $\omega$ is tangent to lines $BC$,
  $CA$, and $AB$, respectively.
The circle $AEF$ intersects line $BC$ at $P$ and $Q$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AD$.
Prove that the circle $MPQ$ is tangent to $\omega$.
