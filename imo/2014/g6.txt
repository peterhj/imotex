Let $ABC$ be a fixed acute-angled triangle.
Consider some points $E$ and $F$ lying on the sides $AC$ and $AB$, respectively,
  and let $M$ be the midpoint of $EF$.
Let the perpendicular bisector of $EF$ intersect the line $BC$ at $K$, and let
  the perpendicular bisector of $MK$ intersect the lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $S$
  and $T$, respectively.
We call the pair $(E,F)$ \emph{interesting} if the quadrilateral $KSAT$ is
  cyclic.
Suppose that the pairs $(E_1,F_1)$ and $(E_2,F_2)$ are interesting.
Prove that
  $$\frac{E_1E_2}{AB} = \frac{F_1F_2}{AC}$$.
