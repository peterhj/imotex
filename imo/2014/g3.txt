Let $\Omega$ and $O$ be the circumcircle and the circumcentre of an acute-angled
  triangle $ABC$ with $AB > BC$.
The angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ intersects $\Omega$ at $M \neq B$.
Let $\Gamma$ be the circle with diameter $BM$.
The angle bisectors of $\angle AOB$ and $\angle BOC$ intersect $\Gamma$ at
  points $P$ and $Q$, respectively.
The point $R$ is chosen on the line $PQ$ so that $BR = MR$.
Prove that $BR \| AC$.
(Here we always assume that an angle bisector is a ray.)
