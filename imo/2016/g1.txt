In a convex pentagon $ABCDE$, let $F$ be a point on $AC$ such that
  $\angle FBC = 90^\circ$.
Suppose triangles $ABF$, $ACD$, and $ADE$ are similar isosceles triangles with
  $\angle FAB = \angle FBA = \angle DAC = \angle DCA = \angle EAD = \angle EDA$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $CF$.
Point $X$ is chosen such that $AMXE$ is a parallelogram.
Show that $BD$, $EM$, and $FX$ are concurrent.
