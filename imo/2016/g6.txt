Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $\angle ABC = \angle ADC < 90^\circ$.
The internal angle bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ADC$ meet $AC$ at $E$
  and $F$ respectively, and meet each other at point $P$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AC$ and let $\omega$ be the circumcircle of triangle
  $BPD$.
Segments $BM$ and $DM$ intersect $\omega$ again at $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
Denote by $Q$ the intersection points of lines $XE$ and $YF$.
Prove that $PQ \perp AC$.
