Let $B = (-1,0)$ and $C = (1,0)$ be fixed points on the coordinate plane.
A nonempty, bounded subset $S$ of the plane is said to be \emph{nice} if
  (i) there is a point $T$ in $S$ such that for every point $Q$ in $S$, the
  segment $TQ$ lies entirely in $S$; and
  (ii) for any triangle $P_1P_2P_3$, there exists a unique point $A$ in $S$ and
  a permutation $\sigma$ of the indices $\{1, 2, 3\}$ for which triangles $ABC$
  and $P_{\sigma(1)}P_{\sigma(2)}P_{\sigma(3)}$ are similar.
Prove that there exist two distinct nice subsets $S$ and $S'$ of the set
  $\{(x,y) : x \geq 0, y \geq 0\}$ such that if $A \in S$ and $A' \in S'$ are
  the unique choices of points in (ii), then the product $BA \cdot BA'$ is
  constant independent of the triangle $P_1P_2P_3$.
