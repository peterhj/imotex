Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$ and incentre $I$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of side $BC$.
Denote by $D$ the foot of the perpendicular from $I$ to side $BC$.
The line through $I$ perpendicular to $AI$ meets sides $AB$ and $AC$ at $F$ and
  $E$ respectively.
Suppose the circumcircle of triangle $AEF$ intersects $\Gamma$ at a point $X$
  other than $A$.
Prove that lines $XD$ and $AM$ meet on $\Gamma$.
