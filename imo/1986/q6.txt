One is given a finite set of points in the plane, each point having integer
  coordinates.
Is it always possible to color some of the points in the set red and the
  remaining points white in such a way that for any straight line $L$ parallel
  to either one of the coordinate axes the difference (in absolute value)
  between the number of white points and red points on $L$ is not greater than
  $1$?
