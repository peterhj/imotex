A triangle $A_1A_2A_3$ and a point $P_0$ are given in the plane.
We define $A_s = A_{s-3}$ for all $s \geq 4$.
We construct a set of points $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, $\ldots$, such that
  $P_{k+1}$ is the image of $P_k$ under a rotation with center $A_{k+1}$
  through angle $120^\circ$ clockwise (for $k = 0$, $1$, $2$, $\ldots$).
Prove that if $P_{1986} = P_0$, then the triangle $A_1A_2A_3$ is equilateral.
