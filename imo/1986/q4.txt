Let $A$, $B$ be adjacent vertices of a regular $n$-gon ($n \ge 5$) in the plane
  having center at $O$.
A triangle $XYZ$, which is congruent to and initially coincides with $OAB$,
  moves in the plane in such a way that $Y$ and $Z$ each trace out the whole
  boundary of the polygon, $X$ remaining inside the polygon.
Find the locus of $X$.
