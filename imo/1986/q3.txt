To each vertex of a regular pentagon an integer is assigned in such a way that
  the sum of all five numbers is positive.
If three consecutive vertices are assigned the numbers $x$, $y$, $z$
  respectively and $y < 0$ then the following operation is allowed:
  the numbers $x$, $y$, $z$ are replaced by $x+y$, $-y$, $z+y$ respectively.
Such an operation is performed repeatedly as long as at least one of the five
  numbers is negative.
Determine whether this procedure necessarily comes to an end after a finite
  number of steps.
