Let $I$ be the incentre of a triangle $ABC$ and $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle.
Let the line $AI$ intersect $\Gamma$ at a point $D \neq A$.
Let $F$ and $E$ be points on side $BC$ and arc $BDC$ respectively such that
  $\angle BAF = \angle CAE < \frac{1}{2} \angle BAC$.
Finally, let $G$ be the midpoint of the segment $IF$.
Prove that the lines $DG$ and $EI$ intersect on $\Gamma$.
