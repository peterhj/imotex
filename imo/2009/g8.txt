Let $ABCD$ be a circumscribed quadrilateral.
Let $g$ be a line through $A$ which meets the segment $BC$ in $M$ and the line
  $CD$ in $N$.
Denote by $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ the incenters of triangles $ABM$, $MNC$, and
  $NDA$, respectively.
Show that the orthocenter of triangle $I_1I_2I_3$ lies on $g$.
