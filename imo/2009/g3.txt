Let $ABC$ be a triangle.
The incircle of $ABC$ touches the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at the points $Z$ and $Y$,
  respectively.
Let $G$ be the point where the lines $BY$ and $CZ$ meet, and let $R$ and $S$ be
  points such that the two quadrilaterals $BCYR$ and $BCSZ$ are parallelograms.
Prove that $GR = GS$.
