Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle.
Let $\omega$ be a circle whose center $L$ lies on the side $BC$.
Suppose that $\omega$ is tangent to $AB$ at $B'$ and to $AC$ at $C'$.
Suppose also that the circumcenter $O$ of the triangle $ABC$ lies on the
  shorter arc $B'C'$ of $\omega$.
Prove that the circumcircle of $ABC$ and $\omega$ meet at two points.
