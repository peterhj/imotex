Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ and circumcircle $\omega$.
Let $D$ and $E$ be the second intersection points of $\omega$ with the lines
  $AI$ and $BI$, respectively.
The chord $DE$ meets $AC$ at a point $F$, and $BC$ at a point $G$.
Let $P$ be the intersection point of the line through $F$ parallel to $AD$ and
  the line through $G$ parallel to $BE$.
Suppose that the tangents to $\omega$ at $A$ and at $B$ meet at a point $K$.
Prove that the three lines $AE$, $BD$, and $KP$ are either parallel or
  concurrent.
