Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex hexagon all of whose sides are tangent to a circle
  $\omega$ with center $O$.
Suppose that the circumcircle of triangle $ACE$ is concentric with $\omega$.
Let $J$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $CD$.
Suppose that the perpendicular from $B$ to $DF$ intersects the line $EO$ at
  a point $K$.
Let $L$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $K$ to $DE$.
Prove that $DJ=DL$.
