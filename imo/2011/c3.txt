Let $\mathcal S$ be a finite set of at least two points in the plane.
Assume that no three points of $\mathcal S$ are collinear.
By a \emph{windmill} we mean a process as follows.
Start with a line $\ell$ going through a point $P\in\mathcal S$.
Rotate $\ell$ clockwise around the \emph{pivot} $P$ until the line contains
  another point $Q$ of $\mathcal S$.
The point $Q$ now takes over as the new pivot.
This process continues indefinitely, with the pivot always being a point from
  $\mathcal S$.
Show that for a suitable $P\in\mathcal S$ and a suitable starting line $\ell$
  containing $P$, the resulting windmill will visit each point of $\mathcal S$
  as a pivot infinitely often.
