Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\omega$.
Let $t$ be a tangent line to $\omega$.
Let $t_a$, $t_b$, and $t_c$ be the lines obtained by reflecting $t$ in the lines
  $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively.
Show that the circumcircle of the triangle determined by the lines $t_a$, $t_b$,
  and $t_c$ is tangent to the circle $\omega$.
