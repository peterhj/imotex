Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $AB \neq BC$.
Denote by $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ the incircles of triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$.
Suppose that there exists a circle $\omega$ inscribed in angle $ABC$, tangent
  to the extensions of line segments $AD$ and $CD$.
Prove that the common external tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect
  on $\omega$.
