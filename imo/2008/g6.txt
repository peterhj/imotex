There is given a convex quadrilateral $ABCD$.
Prove that there exists a point $P$ inside the quadrilateral such that
  $$\angle PAB + \angle PDC = \angle PBC + \angle PAD = \angle PCD + \angle PBA = \angle PDA + \angle PCB = 90^\circ$$
  if and only if the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular.
